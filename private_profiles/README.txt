This plugin allows to restrict the access to profile pages. If the access restriction is enabled (default), every user is only permitted to visit their own profile page but not the profile pages of other users. Admins still can visit all profile pages.

In addition to a site-wide access setting, the users can also be permitted to decide on their own, if they want to allow others access to their profile page. In case they are allowed to do so, they can allow / deny access by a user setting. By default, users are allowed to configure the access. But if they haven't changed the user setting, the access is restricted by default.


Installation:

1. copy the private_profiles folder into the mod folder of your site,

2. enable the plugin in the admin section of your site,

3. check the plugin settings page and change the settings if necessary.
